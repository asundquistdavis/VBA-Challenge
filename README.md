# VBA Challenge Problem
This is the repo for the VBA challenge problem. Problem looks at stock data from over 3 years provided in an .xlsm file and uses a VBA script to summarize data.

## Contents
The .BAS file includes to modules:
    - module 1 runs the script to summarize the stck data by year. For each year it prints the yearly change, percent change as well as the total volume for every ticker included in the data set. It also prints the stock with the greatest percent increase and greatest percent decrease. After running through, the scipt formats the columns as well.
    - modiule 2 clears the data so the program can be run again.

The included screeshots show the script after it's run in the original stock_data.xlsm file. There is one screeshot for each year data is provided.
